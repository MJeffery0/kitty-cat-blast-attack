# üê± Kitty Cat Blast Attack! üê±



I embarked on a Python project utilizing the Pygame framework with the primary objective of deepening my understanding of the language while acquiring hands-on experience. By creating this project, I aimed to sharpen my Python skills, explore the capabilities of the Pygame framework, and broaden my knowledge of programming languages.


## Features üí¨

Kitty Cat Blast Attack is a classic **2D arcade-style shooter game**. You control a cute kitty character who breathes fire! Your objective is to **blast as many mice as you can** before you get overrun by them. 

### Movement
The user may use either the **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move their character.

### Attack
The user may use either the **spacebar** or **left-click** to fire a projectile. The projectile will run horizontally to the right and cannot be aimed otherwise.

### Buffs
For every mouse you defeat, there is a chance that they drop a "buff". There are currently **four buffs** in the game:
- **Health:** This will recover 1HP to your character. This cannot exceed max HP (3HP).
- **Speed:** This will slightly increase the player character speed. This increase lasts until *Game Over*.
- **Projectile Firerate:** This will slightly increase the rate at which you can fire out a projectile. This increase lasts until *Game Over*.
- **Projectile Speed:** This will slightly increase the speed your projectile goes across the screen. This increase lasts until *Game Over*.

### Score & Difficulty
The player will earn 1 point for every mouse they defeat. Upon hitting a score of 50, the game will begin spawning a second mouse. At a score of 100, three mice will start spawning at once.

**The player's objective is to obtain the highest score possible!**
